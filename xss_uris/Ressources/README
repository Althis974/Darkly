First, we click on nsa logo and go on the page "page=media&src=nsa"

After some tests replacing "nsa" with some value like "..", we find out weird behaviour.

Digging into this issue and doing some search, we find out this resource:
"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/"

Then, we try all the classic test to find out XSS issue.

Finally, this one worked:
"src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydDwvc2NyaXB0Pg=="

Last but not least, doing some additional search about why it worked and we find:
"https://www.paladion.net/blogs/bypass-xss-filters-using-data-uris"
And get the flag.

# RESOLUTION

Add a filter to disable capacity of using "data:" in url.
