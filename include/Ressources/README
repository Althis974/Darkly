First, on any page with "index.php?page=", we see that add ".." displays a dialog
box with "Wtf ?".

Then, adding "/.." displays a new dialog box with "Wrong again".

So we just kept doing this until the dialog box displays always the same message:
"You can do it :]"

Some research and we find out that it was an local include break:
https://www.funinformatique.com/faille-include-comment-lexploiter-et-sen-proteger/

Finally, we add exactly :
"../../../../../../../etc/passwd"

Last but not least, a new dialog box appears with a new message.
And get the flag.

# RESOLUTION

- Test all pages and if it happens, redirect to home page.
- In php4, put "allow_url_fopen" to "off".
- In php5, put "allow_url_include" to "off".
