First, using zap tool of OWASP, scanned all urls of the ".hidden" folder.

Then, we get all "README" files with a curl command:
"for val in ${StringArray[@]}; do
   curl $val
done"

Finally, we filter all messages to finally find a hash.
And get the flag.

# RESOLUTION

Don't let access to useless/sensitives files.
